            <h1>Interstate 69 (I-69) is a part of the Interstate Highway System</h1>
            <p>In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the
                cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula.</p>
            <h2>The entirety of I-69 is listed on the National Highway System, which is a network of roadways</h2>
            <p>The freeway carries 91,100 vehicles on average each day between I-475 and M-54 in Flint and 14,085
                vehicles between M-53 and Capac Road near the Lapeerâ€“St. Clair county line, the highest and lowest
                traffic counts in 2012, respectively.</p>
            <h3>After leaving the I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes cardinal orientation and is signed as eastâ€“west from
                that point on.</h3>
            <p>The freeway continues parallel to the Looking Glass River through suburban areas north of Capital Region
                International Airport. North of East Lansing, I-69 meets US 127 at a cloverleaf interchange.</p>
