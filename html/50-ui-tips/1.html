            <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to make
                a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing
                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions
                of Lorem Ipsum.
            </p>

            <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage, and
                going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                Ipsum
                comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                Evil) by
                Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                Renaissance.
                The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
            <p>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at
                its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                as
                opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                publishing
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
                ipsum'
                will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                sometimes by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
