# How to import CSS class names in React properly

In this video I'll show you how to make your React application more reliable. Your components and class names will always be consistent. And the next time, when you remove the class name so that it no longer exists, you will get a compilation error.

In this video you'll also know how to fix the Cannot find module './App.css' error. If you want to properly import CSS classes into TSX by checking for their existence when compiling your application, implement this approach so that you don't have inconsistencies between your components and styles.
